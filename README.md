This tool provide a UI to convert audible audiobook to mp3

# Introduction

This tool is only to convert your OWN audiobook from Audible to MP3.
I provide this tool following french law on private copy for personnal usage. 

I will not provide any support to convert and distribute audiobook if you are not the owner.

This tool can help if you want listen your favorite audiobook : 
* with a USB stick in your car
* on your Linux distribution

You will need your activation bytes from https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator


# Anti-Piracy Notice
Note that this project does NOT 'crack' the DRM. It simplys allows the user to use their own encryption key (fetched from https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator) to decrypt the audiobook in the same manner that the official audiobook playing software does.

Please only use this application for gaining full access to your own audiobooks for archiving/converson/convenience. DeDRMed audiobooks should not be uploaded to open servers, torrents, or other methods of mass distribution. No help will be given to people doing such things. Authors, retailers, and publishers all need to make a living, so that they can continue to produce audiobooks for us to hear, and enjoy. Don't be a parasite.
